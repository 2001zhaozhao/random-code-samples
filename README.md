# random-kotlin-code-samples
An assortment of code samples from my Kotlin projects. These samples are representative of the quality of my typical code. Because I expect these codebases to be used in production and improved upon over several years, I emphasize readability, documentation, and performance in my code style.

Projects covered by the portfolio:

* guncolony: The [GunColony](https://guncolony.com/) first-person shooter game based on Minecraft, launched in 2015. Much of the codebase is rather old, so I am choosing to show portions of the newer code representative of my current code quality.
* guncolony2: The new browser game sequel to GunColony, using Kotlin Multiplatform. Work on the game's custom engine began in July 2022. The project includes a mixture of client (JS), server (JVM), and common (multiplatform) code.
* MultiServer: My student project "Concurrent Simulation of Multiplayer Game Worlds in Minecraft", which implements *Star Citizen*-style server meshing in Minecraft to create concurrent worlds that can hold thousands of players.
